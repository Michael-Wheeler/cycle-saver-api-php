# Cycle Saver API

Cycle saver is a service that consumes your pedal powered commute data and compares it to alternative modes of transport. 
This allows you to see how much money you saved on buses or trains, how many hours of traffic you filtered through and how much pollution you didn't produce.

The first phase of integrations will include Strava for activity tracking and TfL for public transport data. This can be expanded where necessary, 
especially where it enables calculation of transport costs outside of London.
